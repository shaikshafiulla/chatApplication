**Terminal Chat Application using Node.js with TCP/IP Protocol**</br></br></br>
**1. Introduction**</br></br>
This application is developed using Node.js with TCP/IP protocol. The application allows users to chat with one another. The server can handle multiple clients simultaneously, and the clients can communicate with one another through both 1:1 chat and group chat. Additionally, the application includes several features, such as authentication, group management, and encryption.

**3. Dependencies** </br></br>
The chat application requires the following software and hardware specifications:</br>
Node.js </br>
MongoDB</br>
To run the chat application, follow these steps:</br>
Start the server by running **node server.js**.</br>
Start a client by running **node start.js** and on successful authentication user will be redirected to connect with server.</br>

**4. Authentication**</br></br>
The chat application uses a fixed username and password for client authentication. The client must provide a valid username and password to connect to the server. The server checks the provided credentials against a MongoDB database of registered users. If the credentials are valid, the server grants the client access to the chat application.</br>
The password is encrypted and stored in the MongoDB database using a **public-private key encryption strategy**. In the database the password is stored in encrypted format after performing the encryption with public key.</br>
--> the user can not do multiple logins with the same username and password.</br></br></br>

**5. Group Chatting**</br></br>
The chat application allows users to create, join, and manage groups. Only the group administrator can delete a group or remove a user from a group. The following group  functions are available to users:</br>
**Create Group**: Users can create a new group and become the group administrator. If the group already exist, he canâ€™t create the group with the same name.</br>
**Join Group**: Users can join an existing group by providing the group name. And if user joins the group, he will get messages if anyone from that group sends a message.</br>
**Delete Group**: The group administrator can delete a group by providing the group name.</br>
**Remove User from Group**: The group administrator can remove a user from a group by providing the username.</br>
**Disconnect From Group**: Users can disconnect from the group they have joined by providing the username. The users are allowed to join another group only if he exits from the current group.</br></br></br>




**6. Chat Functionality**</br></br>
The chat application supports both 1:1 chat and group chat. Users can send messages, request 1:1 chat session, accept 1:1 chat request, and disconnect from 1:1 chat or group chat sessions. The following chat functions are available to users:</br>

**Send Message**: Users can send a message to a specific user by providing the recipient's id. And the message can be only sent to the other user if recipient user accepts the request.</br>
**Request 1:1 Chat Session**: Users can request a 1:1 chat session with another user by providing the id. The recipient will receive a chat request and can choose to accept the request from sender.</br>
**Get Requests**: Users can get a list of requests who have made a 1:1 chat request with the clients. This functionality helps the user to accept a request.</br>
**Accept 1:1 Chat Request**: If a user receives a 1:1 chat request, they can choose to accept the request and begin a 1:1 chat session.</br>
**Disconnect from 1:1 Chat Session**: Users can disconnect from an ongoing 1:1 chat session at any time by entering the recipient client id.</br></br></br>

**7. Other Chat Features**</br></br>
The chat application includes the following additional features:</br>
**Show Active Clients**: Users can view a list of all active clients currently connected to the server.</br>
**Show Active Groups**: Users can view a list of all active groups currently available in the chat application.</br>
**Change Password**: Users can change their password by providing the new password.</br>
**Logout**: Users can disconnect from the server and log out of the chat application at any time.</br></br></br>

**8. Conclusion**</br></br>
The terminal chat application developed using Node.js with TCP/IP protocol provides a platform for users to communicate with one another. The application includes several features such as authentication, group management, and encryption.</br>
